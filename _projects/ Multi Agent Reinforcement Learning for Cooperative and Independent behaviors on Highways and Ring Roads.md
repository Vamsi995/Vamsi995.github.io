This project is an extension to the work done by Prof. Cathy Wu in the paper [Dissipating stop-and-go waves in closed and open networks via deep reinforcement learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8569485) and the work of Fang-Chieh Chou in the paper [The Lord of the Ring Road: A Review and Evaluation of Autonomous Control Policies for Traffic in a Ring Road](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3494577), where we explore the decentralized coordinated multi agent version using algorithms like QMIX, VDN to dissipate traffic congestion waves.
