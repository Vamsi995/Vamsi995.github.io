title: "Network measurements for telehealth optimizations understanding internet paths in remote regions"
layout: single
excerpt: "Telehealth primarily relies on the availability of reliable Internet connectivity. However, Internet access can be challenging in remote regions far from the major Internet hubs. Such poor connectivity can prevent access to telehealth, where there is a tremendous need due to limited local healthcare facilities. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the exterior gateway protocol of the Internet, is not optimized for performance or shortest path. However, understanding network paths in remote regions of the Internet can enable network architectures tailored for telehealth access in remote regions. This paper explores the Internet landscape in Alaska, a vast remote region in the USA as far as the Internet access is concerned."

Telehealth primarily relies on the availability of reliable Internet connectivity. However, Internet access can be challenging in remote regions far from the major Internet hubs. Such poor connectivity can prevent access to telehealth, where there is a tremendous need due to limited local healthcare facilities. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the exterior gateway protocol of the Internet, is not optimized for performance or shortest path. However, understanding network paths in remote regions of the Internet can enable network architectures tailored for telehealth access in remote regions. This paper explores the Internet landscape in Alaska, a vast remote region in the USA as far as the Internet access is concerned. Our study reveals how the stateâ€™s geography impacts internet connectivity and provides insights into global connection routes. Leveraging the capabilities of RIPE Atlas, we study the Internet ecosystem in the northern state on various metrics, such as route paths and latency. We consider our network measurements an early step towards understanding the network paths and performance in the circumpolar north and other remote regions. Such measurements pave the way for simulated algorithms that could optimize telehealth access. Using Internet measurements as a core building block, we present our integrated approach to telehealth optimizations through network measurements and understanding network paths.
