An autonomous, robust, and affordable robot for farmers who require efficient and safe pesticide spraying. The robot uses simple electronics to autonomously navigate fields while spraying pesticides by detecting plants. The chassis has a unique closed design enabling our robot to spray pesticide efficiently such that it reaches all the parts of the plant, avoid dispersion of pesticides due to wind and also stay in close proximity to the plant to enable efficient detection. 

We won first place in the Tata Center of Technology and Development (TCTD) Challenge in Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 at IIT Bombay for developing proof of concept “Automated Pesticide Spraying Robot” for the problem statement “ Farm tools that reduce drudgery.
