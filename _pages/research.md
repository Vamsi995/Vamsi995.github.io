My research interestes include reinforcement learning, natural language processing, customizable AI.

## Research Experience

- **Summer Research Intern - CiSTUP Lab - IISc Bangalore**
    - Working on developing coordinated MARL (Mutli Agent Reinforcement Learning) algorithms for collision avoidance in open traffic systems and to mitigate phantom jams in closed traffic systems.
    - Setting up custom RL environments using PyGame and OpenAI Gym and running simulations leveraging Tensorflow GPU

- **Research Intern - Infinity Labs - UST Global**
    - Worked on building production level Paraphrase Generator using SOTA NLP transformer architectures.
    - Developed a web API using streamlit and flask for model inference.
    - Built a data generation CLI tool using the paraphrase generator for creating datasets with similar semantics
    - Contributed a model to the open-source hugging face library. https://huggingface.co/Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws
