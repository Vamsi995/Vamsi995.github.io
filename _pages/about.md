I am a fresh graduate from IIT Palakkad majoring in Computer Science & Engineering with a potent blend of industry and research experiences. I am interested in problem-solving be it in a social aspect or analytical aspect, and nothing brings me more joy than solving something that is on the cutting edge of research and on the verge of being something new. I am passionate about building the next generation of tech that is going to revolutionize humanity. I draw my passion from my deep interest in applied mathematics, and how math can disentangle convoluted symmetries and abstract patterns in nature through simple equations.

I specialize in software development, full-stack web development, and Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning, especially in the field of Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am proficient with Python, Javascript, Java and C, and I am comfortable with the frameworks like Node.js, Angular, React, Flutter, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. I have solid research experience working under esteemed professors and also good industry exposure from my internships.

Apart from programming, I enjoy making pencil sketches, traveling, and playing badminton. I am always excited to meet new people and learn new things. Reach me at saivamsi.ds123@gmail.com.
